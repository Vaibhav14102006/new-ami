Points to be integrated 
Use case: After login, show a page asking users to choose a profile ("teachers", and “students”).
In the Teacher’s Login Dashboard, there should be ability to create a new test and manually add questions and 4 options ( The Option can include complex mathematic number and symbols) 




The AmiQuiz platform now has a solid foundation with both traditional and social authentication methods, a well-structured database, and a responsive UI. We need to complete the integration between Firebase authentication and our backend services
